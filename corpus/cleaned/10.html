<p>This small but modern city in the Netherlands has its place in history as the venue for the Battle of Zutphen, memorable for the fact that Sir Philip Sidney, renowned poet of the Elizabethan Age, died of the mortal wound he suffered there. However, Zutphen has a few other claims to fame, notable among them being the St. Walburgis church, a Gothic monument that dates back to the twelfth century. The Restaurant 't Schulten Hues, neighbour to this historic building, is a worthy contender among the restaurants which  add to the allure of this quaint and charming city.</p>
<p>Located in a listed building that goes back to 1881, and built in a style reminiscent of the Neo Renaissance, this restaurant adopts French cuisine with flair and turns out a variety of inspiring and well presented dishes. The brooding elements of the architecture, that have mostly been retained, lend a touch of mystery, while the terrace with its herb garden and view of nearby orchards is a delightful spot for al fresco dining.</p>
<p>Owner and Chef Peter Gast brings his passion and range of experiences to the kitchen and patrons get a taste of his expertise with the amuse bouche of green pepper and olive pastilles or the beetroot and pistachio bonbon. Oyster lovers will rejoice as they could choose from different preparations - in jus of blood orange, olive and almond foam coffee, or champagne vinegar and crème of cured ham - for starters. These perfectly balanced morsels are well conceived and deliver without fail; other options include crabs rolled in pumpkin with yoghurt and a sesame and ginger mousse.</p>
<p>The French pride themselves on their poisson and at Schulten Hues, you could sample the sole fillets with cream of potato or the unusual combination of pike perch with kale. Shrimps and snails, other favourites, also make their presence felt on the menu, while duck served with cream of artichoke, marinated apple, celeriac and a jus with sherry is a most interesting and fitting main course.</p>
<p>For dessert, try the passion fruit with yoghurt and let the intense and sweet flavours mingle favourably. French wines dominate the list and there is one to complement every stage of the meal. Whether you are a visitor to Zutphen or even a local, a meal at Schulten Hues is something that should not be overlooked. As  Chef Peter Gast says, 'Cooking is theatre' for him, so don't lose the opportunity to take part in the drama that he gently builds up with every gastronomic delight.</p>

<p>Abacanto, a splendid place serving international cuisine with an Italian twist, is situated at the back of this building. It features a covered outdoor area for al fresco banquets, a bar and a dining room with a view of the kitchen. The decor is a mix of classic and contemporary with highlights of abstract paintings and projections of surreal forms on the wall.</p>
<p>The restaurant provides a mix of fun and serious dining for customers through its various offerings. Whether you want to just enjoy a drink while listening to live music - which ranges from solo piano performances, to jazz bands, to the latest techno tracks spun by reputed DJs - or dance the night away, it should fit pleasantly with whatever mood you?re in. The specially equipped bar is a good spot to start your evening with cocktails and snacks before moving on to satisfy your gastronomic aspirations.</p>
<p>Carpaccio of shellfish and satay, or tapijtschelpjes in white wine, spicy cherry tomatoes, parsley, garlic and toasted bread is a good starter. Biancaneve, a pizza with thin, crunchy crust generously topped with buffalo mozzarella, Parma ham, thinly sliced rocket parmigiano is a good option for main course. Cassata siciliana with cake, ricotta, cinnamon or chocolate, candied fruit and marzipan for dessert brings down the curtain on a good meal.</p>

<p>The sleek, surreal and bordering on provocative Supperclub has been one of Amsterdam's hottest nightspots with a wild and exciting menu, and owner Bert van der Leden's latest brainchild, Envy, promises to be an equally enticing venue, particularly with regards to gourmet food. </p>
<p>The sparkling stainless steel open kitchen is striking and grabs your attention right away, where you could watch the chefs as they prepare your meal. In a play of contrasts, the dining area is all wood, with low lit lamps and has a warm and cosy atmosphere while long tables with elevated bar stools provide an intimate and friendly ambience. And how can anyone miss the sight of twenty six refrigerators lining the walls behind the counter where chrome handles and oak panelling elevate the ordinary ice box into a stunning showcase for the wonderful desserts, oysters, cheeses and wines on their menu?</p>
<p>Designed to look like an Italian delicatessen, the focus is on fresh and unassuming flavours, and with a Michelin Bib Gourmand to back it up, Envy comes up with some magnificent creations to seduce the senses. Sample the tomato sorbet with lobster and foam of mozzarella for a vivid and decidedly different experience. </p>
<p>The absence of a traditional menu makes way for experimentation and you could start with the smoky salami tinged with truffle or an Italian soft sausage with a hint of pistachio. Other noteworthy dishes include the crispy pata negra with farm egg and hollandaise; open ravioli with a celeriac ragout; slowly baked quail egg with a sauce of red port and skin baked codfish with aubergine, arganol, clams and foam of lemon and kefir. The portions are a tad small, but nevertheless satisfying on a sensual level.</p>
<p>Luscious crème brûlée, sinfully smooth ice creams and sorbets with an assortment of sauces comprise the desserts, while cheeses flown in from France, Switzerland and Italy complete the list. An excellent selection of wines complements the meal, while the helpful and knowledgeable staff put you at ease with anecdotes and interesting trivia about the food on your table.</p>
<p>The chef's menu offers value for money and most diners can be seen tucking into a variety of deli meats, warm and cold dishes and a number of miniature desserts, triggering a reaction of 'I want whatever they're having' from you. Envying thy neighbour is no longer just one of those seven deadly sins, and is probably a commonplace occurrence there, if the buzz in this chic and trendy place is anything to go by.</p>

<p>Golden Bend in Herengracht was once home to wealthy citizens of Amsterdam but has now paved the way to house banks, insurance companies and cultural associations. Restaurant Het Tuynhuys was formerly a coaching inn in a seventeenth century mansion and the period façade leads you into a bright and charming space. With a name that literally translates into 'garden house' this large restaurant attracts a wide spectrum of customers. </p>
<p>The split-level dining area is for those who enjoy space, comfort and intimacy, while the upper level is the best bet for large parties. The interior is vivid with well-spaced tables, candles and neutrally shaded walls partly covered with chequered prints. During summer months, step outside to the terraced garden filled with flowers and hedges, and let the warmth of the sun help you reminisce about your last Mediterranean holiday. </p>
<p>The cooking will appeal to the appetites of those who seek recognisable French favourites with the occasional European twist. Skilfully crafted with exceptional ingredients, the food harmoniously blends in flavours and is appealingly presented. The daily tasting menu allows diners to sample a variety of dishes per course.</p>
<p>Marinated and thinly sliced veal may appear with tuna tartar, anchovy mayonnaise and crispy chips of Roseval potato for starters, while a marbled terrine of duck liver and salted meat is served with prune jam and brioche. Carrot soup á la tom yum with scallions and guinea fowl hint at the Chinese origins of the owner. Mains take in pan-fried turbot in crispy and delicate kadaifi dough with sweet potato, morilles and veal jus; fillet of beef with duck liver confit, homemade gnocchi and a truffle sauce, and rack of lamb with German dumplings and date and lemon compote.</p>
<p>Desserts embrace curd with raspberries, dark chocolate chips and Belgium waffles, and red fruit with champagne sabayon, twelve year old balsamico and almond florentines. Their well chosen wine list enables coordinated pairing with the food and unusually you could select a different recommended wine, served by the glass, with each course. So if you are in Amsterdam and are looking for a pleasant eating destination with discreet service and an eclectic menu, then Restaurant Het Tuynhuys may just be the place.</p>

<p>The Estate of Wolfslaar is steeped in history, dating back to the Middle Ages. In its previous incarnation it was a farmstead, complete with meadows, fields and a large vegetable garden, then a stately home before being sold to the town of Breda. In 1998 Ton Pixten entered the scene and transformed this place into one of the city's most chic addresses with classic architecture and contemporary cooking.</p>
<p>Wolfslaar Restaurant is housed in a former coaching inn but traces of its boisterous past have been deftly camouflaged in the delightful surroundings. The large lighting feature above the bar area is elegantly designed and exudes an aura of charm. On the first floor is the vide salon and salon prive, the private dining areas whose wooden beams, tile roofs and small windows evoke admiration.. When weather permits, step out for an al fresco meal and hear the rustling of leaves on the stone cobbled terrace and the birdsong in the woods beyond. Surely a welcome change from the high decibel levels at city pubs and cafés!</p>
<p>Head Chef Maarten Camps's cooking is honest and refined, which could just explain why the restaurant won a coveted Michelin star in 2005. Just watch the man as he skilfully combines rhubarb with ginger or veal with turnip celery purée and black truffle; he attributes these smart combinations to the seasons and the feel of the vegetables and fish in his hands - so no prizes for guessing why the menu changes regularly.</p>
<p>The chef's signature dishes of sardines marinated in olive oil, new potato, salted lemon, cream paprika and Spanish pepper; crayfish poached gently in fenugreek, crayfish sauce and caramelized coulis and yoghourt sorbet with raspberry coulis demonstrate real innovation. Starters embrace foie gras with salad and a refreshing ox tail soup, and Dutch new herring with radish, green apple and caviar. </p>
<p>Vegetarians are in for a treat with dishes like tagliatelle with basil, pine nuts, cheese and zucchini and fish lovers could hardly pass by the plaice roasted on a grill and squid with gnocchi, hard cheese, and spinach. The scrumptious Duke of Berkshire pork belly, one of the rare breeds of England, is accompanied by potatoes and winter truffle sauce while a dessert of strawberries and white chocolate with lemon green foam and milfoil provides a fitting finale. </p>
<p>The adjacent country house, magnificent in its archetypal grandeur, is a hub of activity playing host to weddings, business meetings and culinary workshops. Surrounded by lush greenery, Wolfslaar Restaurant could be a termed as a byword for everything that is excellent and sophisticated.</p>

 Lepels Eten en Drinken, located in Short Haven, serves contemporary French and Mediterranean cuisine. The space there is divided into three parts: the lounge, which sports a comfortable setting where you can order either aperitifs and snacks, or an after dinner coffee; the dining area, where black and white colours set the tone and timber and other natural elements give it a warm aura, and the boat, a recent addition, which promises a unique experience.

<p>The place offers beautiful views of the Short Harbour and the properties within and you can sample the now renowned Limburgs leaven bread with olive oil as you watch the sunset or listen to your companion's latest exploits. When weather permits, you could enjoy sunshine and food on the lovely terrace. </p>
<p>Marc Smeets and Kim Hilbink, the founders, identified this magnificent building on the bank of the Schiedam canal for their venture. They also had two clear goals in mind when they designed their product: the fare should change daily and customers should be able to choose between full and half portions. Today, their patrons revel in the opportunity to tuck into a wider variety from the menu, providing proof of the concept's success.</p>
<p>Expect to find cold choices such as coquille, which is gazpacho soup - a cold soup made with local ingredients which include broken bread, olive oil, vinegar, garlic and water - with fried cherry tomatoes, salad of king crab from the Bering Sea and strips of spring turnip, and raw tuna served with jelly broth and sweet and sour ginger vinaigrette. Others can try the tartare of beef with summer truffles and crispy fried lobster with cream of champagne vinegar.</p>
<p>Steaming hot offerings could include poached sea bass in broth, saffron, ravioli stuffed with serrano ham and filet of griet, a kind of flatfish, with a jus of crustaceans and beetroot, and crispy pancetta bacon. For vegetarians there is artichoke and morbier cheese, grilled green asparagus and mushrooms with sauce of red peppers.</p>
<p>Whatever you choose, an evening out there is bound to leave you with a pleasant aftertaste and make you long for another visit as soon as you get a chance.</p>
